# Checklist for submitting homework

- Enter your Neptun code in the neptun.txt file located in the root directory of the repository. The code should be in uppercase letters only, and the file should contain only these six charactersâ€”nothing else.
- Work within the solution/projects downloaded from GitHub, not in a newly created project.
- If you are not yet experienced in using Visual Studio's Git features, after pushing your changes (or at the latest when you consider your homework submitted), it is advisable to check the repository on GitHub's web interface to ensure that all changes have been successfully uploaded.
- After pushing, check on GitHub to see if the GitHub Action-based pre-check has run without errors.
- Assignments will only be accepted if they are fully completed and meet all the requirements. Do not expect acceptance of non-compiling code or partial solutions.
- Naturally, you must submit your own work, as it will be evaluated.
