## Submitting assignments

Each homework solution must be submitted in a personal Git repository. The exact [submission process can be found here](./hf-folyamat/index_eng.md). Please read the description carefully!

!!!danger "IMPORTANT"
    You must follow the instructions described here when preparing and submitting homework. Assignments not submitted in this format will not be evaluated.

Some homework assignments include an automated pre-checker, which you can read more about [here](./eloellenorzes-ertekeles/index_eng.md).

## Screenshots

Certain assignments require you to take a screenshot of a specific part of your solution to prove that you created the solution yourself. The required content of the screenshots is explicitly specified in each assignment.

!!!info ""
    Screenshots must be submitted as part of the solution, so they will be included in the Git repository along with the content. Since the repository is private, only instructors can see it. If the screenshot contains any content you do not want to upload, you may censor it before submission.

## Required tools

The primary development environment required is Visual Studio 2022. A more detailed description can be found [here](./fejlesztokornyezet/index_eng.md).
