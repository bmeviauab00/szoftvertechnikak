# Homework workflow and using Git/GitHub

If you haven't read it yet, it's advisable to start here: [Git, GitHub, GitHub Classroom](../git-github-github-classroom/index_eng.md)

## Steps

The initial framework of each homework assignment is published using GitHub/GitHub Classroom. The steps for downloading and submitting the homework from this published environment are as follows:

1. :exclamation: Do not wait until the deadline approaches to start. At least get to the point of creating your repository as soon as possible. This way, if you run into any issues, we can assist you in time.
2. Register a GitHub account (<https://github.com/>) if you haven’t already, and log in to GitHub.
3. Open the link corresponding to the assignment. Each assignment will have a different link, which will be gradually announced on the subject webpage throughout the semester. The format will be similar to: <https://classroom.github.com/abcdefgh>. If you encounter an authentication error ("There was a problem authenticating with GitHub, please try again."), try copying and pasting the link directly into the browser's address bar.
4. If prompted, grant GitHub Classroom permission to use your account information.
5. You will see a page where you can accept the assignment ("Accept this assignment"). Click the button.
6. Wait for the repository to be created. GitHub does not always refresh the page automatically, so manually refreshing (e.g., pressing F5) may be necessary. Once the repository is ready, the page will display its URL, which you can click to access the repository (e.g., <https://github.com/bmeviauab00/hazi1-2024-username>). However, saving the URL is not strictly necessary, as you can always find it later among your repositories on the GitHub homepage (<https://github.com/>).
7. Clone the repository (we will discuss how to do this shortly). Inside, you will find a framework or starter code. Work on this and modify it as needed. Stay on the default Git branch (if this doesn't mean anything to you, don't worry—this note is primarily for those who are experienced in Git and usually work with multiple branches).
8. :exclamation: Do not modify, delete, or alter the content of the `.github/workflows` folder within the project.
9. :exclamation: You must work within the provided solution/project from the initial repository. Do not create a new project/solution.
10. :exclamation: Enter your *Neptun code* in the `neptun.txt` file located in the root directory of the repository. The file should contain **only these six uppercase characters** and nothing else.
11. Solve the assignment and push your changes before the deadline. Work directly on the default "Main" branch—there are no pull requests. You can have as many commits as needed; we will evaluate the latest state at the deadline.
12. Results will be announced on Aut webpage. Expect results within a few days after the submission deadline.
13. There is no need to explicitly submit the assignment separately—just make sure it is available on GitHub by the deadline.
14. :exclamation: Before considering your homework as submitted, it is advisable to check your repository on GitHub's web interface to ensure that all changes have been pushed and that the `neptun.txt` file has been properly filled out.
